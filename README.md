# Dataclasses JSON

This library provides a simple API for encoding and decoding [dataclasses](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/) to and from JSON.

It's recursive (see caveats below), so you can easily work with nested dataclasses.

In addition to the supported types in the [py to JSON table](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#py-to-json-table), any arbitrary
[Collection](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Collection) type is supported (they are encoded into JSON arrays, but decoded into the original collection types).

**The [latest release](https://github.com/lidatong/dataclasses-json/releases/latest) is compatible with both Python 3.7 and Python 3.6 (with the dataclasses backport).** 

## Quickstart
`pip install dataclasses-json`

#### Approach 1: Class decorator

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json

@dataclass_json
@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str

lidatong = Person('lidatong')

# Encoding to JSON
encoded_lidatong = lidatong.to_json()
assert encoded_lidatong == '{"name": "lidatong"}'

# Decoding from JSON
decoded_lidatong = Person.from_json('{"name": "lidatong"}')
assert decoded_lidatong == lidatong
```

Note that the `@dataclass_json` decorator must be stacked above the `@dataclass`
decorator (order matters!)

#### Approach 2: Inherit from a mixin

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import DataClassJsonMixin

@dataclass
class Person(DataClassJsonMixin):
    name: str

lidatong = Person('lidatong')

# A different example from Approach 1 above, but usage is the exact same
assert Person.from_json(lidatong.to_json()) == lidatong
```

Pick whichever approach suits your taste. The differences in implementation are
invisible in usage.

## A larger example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import DataClassJsonMixin
from typing import List


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Minion(DataClassJsonMixin):
    name: str


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Boss(DataClassJsonMixin):
    minions: List[Minion]

boss = Boss([Minion('evil minion'), Minion('very evil minion')])
boss_json = """
{
    "minions": [
        {
            "name": "evil minion"
        },
        {
            "name": "very evil minion"
        }
    ]
}
""".strip()

assert boss.to_json(indent=4) == boss_json
assert Boss.from_json(boss_json) == boss
```


## Caveats
Data Classes that contain forward references (e.g. recursive dataclasses) are
not currently supported.
