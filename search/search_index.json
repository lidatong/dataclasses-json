It's very easy to get started. Documentation website Quickstart pip install dataclasses-json from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json @dataclass_json @dataclass class SimpleExample : int_field : int simple_example = SimpleExample ( 1 ) # Encoding to JSON. Note the output is a string, not a dictionary. simple_example . to_json () # {\"int_field\": 1} # Encoding to a (JSON) dict simple_example . to_dict () # {'int_field': 1} # Decoding from JSON.

CAMEL ) # now all fields are encoded/decoded from camelCase @dataclass class ConfiguredSimpleExample : int_field : int ConfiguredSimpleExample ( 1 ) . to_json () # {\"intField\": 1} ConfiguredSimpleExample . from_json ( '{\"intField\": 1}' ) # ConfiguredSimpleExample(1) Supported types It's recursive (see caveats below), so you can easily work with nested dataclasses. In addition to the supported types in the py to JSON table , this library supports the following: any arbitrary Collection type is supported. Mapping types are encoded as JSON objects and str types as JSON strings. Any other Collection types are encoded into JSON arrays, but decoded into the original collection types. datetime objects. datetime objects are encoded to float (JSON number) using timestamp . As specified in the datetime docs, if your datetime object is naive, it will assume your system local timezone when calling .timestamp() . JSON nunbers corresponding to a datetime field in your dataclass are decoded into a datetime-aware object, with tzinfo set to your system local timezone. Thus, if you encode a datetime-naive object, you will decode into a datetime-aware object. This is important, because encoding and decoding won't strictly be inverses. See this section if you want to override this default behavior (for example, if you want to use ISO). UUID objects. They are encoded as str (JSON string). The latest release is compatible with both Python 3.7 and Python 3.6 (with the dataclasses backport). Usage Approach 1: Class decorator from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json @dataclass_json @dataclass class Person : name : str lidatong = Person ( 'lidatong' ) # Encoding to JSON lidatong . to_json () # '{\"name\": \"lidatong\"}' # Decoding from JSON Person . from_json ( '{\"name\": \"lidatong\"}' ) # Person(name='lidatong') Note that the @dataclass_json decorator must be stacked above the @dataclass decorator (order matters!) Approach 2: Inherit from a mixin from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import DataClassJsonMixin @dataclass class Person ( DataClassJsonMixin ): name : str lidatong = Person ( 'lidatong' ) # A different example from Approach 1 above, but usage is the exact same assert Person . from_json ( lidatong . to_json ()) == lidatong Pick whichever approach suits your taste. The differences in implementation are invisible in usage. How do I... Use my dataclass with JSON arrays or objects? from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json @dataclass_json @dataclass class Person : name : str Encode into a JSON array containing instances of my Data Class people_json = [ Person ( 'lidatong' )] Person . schema () . dumps ( people_json , many = True ) # '[{\"name\": \"lidatong\"}]' Decode a JSON array containing instances of my Data Class people_json = '[{\"name\": \"lidatong\"}]' Person . schema () . loads ( people_json , many = True ) # [Person(name='lidatong')] Encode as part of a larger JSON object containing my Data Class (e.g. an HTTP request/response) import json response_dict = { 'response' : { 'person' : Person ( 'lidatong' ) . to_dict () } } response_json = json . dumps ( response_dict ) In this case, we do two steps. First, we encode the dataclass into a python dictionary rather than a JSON string, using .to_dict . Second, we leverage the built-in json.dumps to serialize our dataclass into a JSON string. Decode as part of a larger JSON object containing my Data Class (e.g. an HTTP response) import json response_dict = json . loads ( '{\"response\": {\"person\": {\"name\": \"lidatong\"}}}' ) person_dict = response_dict [ 'response' ] person = Person . from_dict ( person_dict ) In a similar vein to encoding above, we leverage the built-in json module. First, call json.loads to read the entire JSON object into a dictionary. We then access the key of the value containing the encoded dict of our Person that we want to decode ( response_dict['response'] ). Second, we load in the dictionary using Person.from_dict . Encode or decode into Python lists/dictionaries rather than JSON? This can be by calling .schema() and then using the corresponding encoder/decoder methods, ie. .load(...) / .dump(...) . Encode into a single Python dictionary person = Person ( 'lidatong' ) person . to_dict () # {'name': 'lidatong'} Encode into a list of Python dictionaries people = [ Person ( 'lidatong' )] Person . schema () . dump ( people , many = True ) # [{'name': 'lidatong'}] Decode a dictionary into a single dataclass instance person_dict = { 'name' : 'lidatong' } Person . from_dict ( person_dict ) # Person(name='lidatong') Decode a list of dictionaries into a list of dataclass instances people_dicts = [{ \"name\" : \"lidatong\" }] Person . schema () . load ( people_dicts , many = True ) # [Person(name='lidatong')] Encode or decode from camelCase (or kebab-case)? JSON letter case by convention is camelCase, in Python members are by convention snake_case. You can configure it to encode/decode from other casing schemes at both the class level and the field level. from dataclasses import dataclass , field from dataclasses_json import LetterCase , config , dataclass_json # changing casing at the class level @dataclass_json ( letter_case = LetterCase . CAMEL ) @dataclass class Person : given_name : str family_name : str Person ( 'Alice' , 'Liddell' ) . to_json () # '{\"givenName\": \"Alice\"}' Person . from_json ( '{\"givenName\": \"Alice\", \"familyName\": \"Liddell\"}' ) # Person('Alice', 'Liddell') # at the field level @dataclass_json @dataclass class Person : given_name : str = field ( metadata = config ( letter_case = LetterCase . CAMEL )) family_name : str Person ( 'Alice' , 'Liddell' ) . to_json () # '{\"givenName\": \"Alice\"}' # notice how the `family_name` field is still snake_case, because it wasn't configured above Person . from_json ( '{\"givenName\": \"Alice\", \"family_name\": \"Liddell\"}' ) # Person('Alice', 'Liddell') This library assumes your field follows the Python convention of snake_case naming. If your field is not snake_case to begin with and you attempt to parameterize LetterCase , the behavior of encoding/decoding is undefined (most likely it will result in subtle bugs). Encode or decode using a different name from dataclasses import dataclass , field from dataclasses_json import config , dataclass_json @dataclass_json @dataclass class Person : given_name : str = field ( metadata = config ( field_name = \"overriddenGivenName\" )) Person ( given_name = \"Alice\" , family_name = 'Liddell' ) # Person('Alice') Person . from_json ( '{\"overriddenGivenName\": \"Alice\"}' ) # Person('Alice') Person ( 'Alice' , 'Liddell' ) . to_json () # {\"overriddenGivenName\": \"Alice\"} Handle missing or optional field values when decoding? By default, any fields in your dataclass that use default or default_factory will have the values filled with the provided default, if the corresponding field is missing from the JSON you're decoding. Decode JSON with missing field @dataclass_json @dataclass class Student : id : int name : str = 'student' Student . from_json ( '{\"id\": 1}' ) # Student(id=1, name='student') Notice from_json filled the field name with the specified default 'student' when it was missing from the JSON. Sometimes you have fields that are typed as Optional , but you don't necessarily want to assign a default. In that case, you can use the infer_missing kwarg to make from_json infer the missing field value as None . Decode optional field without default @dataclass_json @dataclass class Tutor : id : int student : Optional [ Student ] = None Tutor . from_json ( '{\"id\": 1}' ) # Tutor(id=1, student=None) Personally I recommend you leverage dataclass defaults rather than using infer_missing , but if for some reason you need to decouple the behavior of JSON decoding from the field's default value, this will allow you to do so. Explanation Briefly, on what's going on under the hood in the above examples: calling .schema() will have this library generate a marshmallow schema for you. It also fills in the corresponding object hook, so that marshmallow will create an instance of your Data Class on load (e.g. Person.schema().load returns a Person ) rather than a dict , which it does by default in marshmallow. Performance note .schema() is not cached (it generates the schema on every call), so if you have a nested Data Class you may want to save the result to a variable to avoid re-generation of the schema on every usage. person_schema = Person . schema () person_schema . dump ( people , many = True ) # later in the code... person_schema . dump ( person ) Override the default encode / decode / marshmallow field of a specific field? See Overriding Marshmallow interop Using the dataclass_json decorator or mixing in DataClassJsonMixin will provide you with an additional method .schema() . .schema() generates a schema exactly equivalent to manually creating a marshmallow schema for your dataclass. You can reference the marshmallow API docs to learn other ways you can use the schema returned by .schema() . You can pass in the exact same arguments to .schema() that you would when constructing a PersonSchema instance, e.g. .schema(many=True) , and they will get passed through to the marshmallow schema. from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json @dataclass_json @dataclass class Person : name : str # You don't need to do this - it's generated for you by `.schema()`! from marshmallow import Schema , fields class PersonSchema ( Schema ): name = fields . Str () Overriding / Extending Overriding For example, you might want to encode/decode datetime objects using ISO format rather than the default timestamp . from dataclasses import dataclass , field from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json , config from datetime import datetime from marshmallow import fields @dataclass_json @dataclass class DataClassWithIsoDatetime : created_at : datetime = field ( metadata = config ( encoder = datetime . isoformat , decoder = datetime . fromisoformat , mm_field = fields . DateTime ( format = 'iso' ) ) ) Extending Similarly, you might want to extend dataclasses_json to encode date objects. from dataclasses import dataclass , field from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json , config from datetime import date from marshmallow import fields @dataclass_json @dataclass class DataClassWithIsoDatetime : created_at : date = field ( metadata = config ( encoder = date . isoformat , decoder = date . fromisoformat , mm_field = fields . DateTime ( format = 'iso' ) )) As you can see, you can override or extend the default codecs by providing a \"hook\" via a callable: - encoder : a callable, which will be invoked to convert the field value when encoding to JSON - decoder : a callable, which will be invoked to convert the JSON value when decoding from JSON - mm_field : a marshmallow field, which will affect the behavior of any operations involving .schema() Note that these hooks will be invoked regardless if you're using .to_json / dump / dumps and .from_json / load / loads . So apply overrides / extensions judiciously, making sure to carefully consider whether the interaction of the encode/decode/mm_field is consistent with what you expect! What if I have other dataclass field extensions that rely on metadata All the dataclasses_json.config does is return a mapping, namespaced under the key 'dataclasses_json' . Say there's another module, other_dataclass_package that uses metadata. Here's how you solve your problem: metadata = { 'other_dataclass_package' : 'some metadata...' } # pre-existing metadata for another dataclass package dataclass_json_config = config ( encoder = datetime . isoformat , decoder = datetime . fromisoformat , mm_field = fields . DateTime ( format = 'iso' ) ) metadata . update ( dataclass_json_config ) @dataclass_json @dataclass class DataClassWithIsoDatetime : created_at : datetime = field ( metadata = metadata ) You can also manually specify the dataclass_json configuration mapping. @dataclass_json @dataclass class DataClassWithIsoDatetime : created_at : date = field ( metadata = { 'dataclasses_json' : { 'encoder' : date . isoformat , 'decoder' : date . fromisoformat , 'mm_field' : fields . DateTime ( format = 'iso' ) }} ) A larger example from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json from typing import List @dataclass_json @dataclass ( frozen = True ) class Minion : name : str @dataclass_json @dataclass ( frozen = True ) class Boss : minions : List [ Minion ] boss = Boss ([ Minion ( 'evil minion' ), Minion ( 'very evil minion' )]) boss_json = \"\"\" { \"minions\": [ { \"name\": \"evil minion\" }, { \"name\": \"very evil minion\" } ] } \"\"\" . strip () assert boss . to_json ( indent = 4 ) == boss_json assert Boss . from_json ( boss_json ) == boss Self Recursion Object hierarchies where fields are of the type that they are declared within require a small type hinting trick to declare the forward reference. from typing import Optional from dataclasses import dataclass from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json @dataclass_json @dataclass class Tree (): value : str left : Optional [ 'Tree' ] right : Optional [ 'Tree' ] Avoid using from __future__ import annotations as it will cause problems with the way dataclasses_json accesses the type annotations.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#dataclasses-json","text":"This library provides a simple API for encoding and decoding dataclasses to and from JSON.

Documentation is extracted from live objects' docstrings using Python's __doc__ attribute 1 . Documentation for variables is found by examining objects' abstract syntax trees. What objects are documented? pdoc only extracts public API documentation. 2 All objects (modules, functions, classes, variables) are only considered public if their identifiers don't begin with an underscore ( _ ). 3 In addition, if a module defines __all__ , then only the identifiers contained in this list will be considered public. Otherwise, a module's global identifiers are considered public only if they don't begin with an underscore and are defined in this exact module (i.e. not imported from somewhere else). By transitivity, sub-objects of non-public objects (e.g. submodules of non-public modules, methods of non-public classes etc.) are not public and thus not documented. Where does pdoc get documentation from? In Python, objects like modules, functions, classes, and methods have a special attribute __doc__ which contains that object's documentation string ( docstring ). For example, the following code defines a function with a docstring and shows how to access its contents: >>> def test (): ... \"\"\"This is a docstring.\"\"\" ... pass ... >>> test . __doc__ 'This is a docstring.' It's pretty much the same with classes and modules. See PEP-257 for Python docstring conventions. These docstrings are set as descriptions for each module, class, function, and method listed in the documentation produced by pdoc . pdoc extends the standard use of docstrings in Python in two important ways: by allowing methods to inherit docstrings, and by introducing syntax for docstrings for variables. Docstrings inheritance pdoc considers methods' docstrings inherited from superclass methods', following the normal class inheritance patterns. Consider the following code example: >>> class A : ... def test ( self ) : ... \"\"\" Docstring for A. \"\"\" ... pass ... >>> class B ( A ) : ... def test ( self ) : ... pass ... >>> A . test . __doc__ ' Docstring for A. ' >>> B . test . __doc__ None In Python, the docstring for B.test doesn't exist, even though a docstring was defined for A.test . When pdoc generates documentation for the code such as above, it will automatically attach the docstring for A.test to B.test if B.test does not define its own docstring. In the default HTML template, such inherited docstrings are greyed out. Docstrings for variables Python by itself doesn't allow docstrings attached to variables . However, pdoc supports docstrings attached to module (or global) variables, class variables, and object instance variables; all in the same way as proposed in PEP-224 , with a docstring following the variable assignment. For example: module_variable = 1 \"\"\" Docstring for module_variable. \"\"\" class C : class_variable = 2 \"\"\" Docstring for class_variable. \"\"\" def __init__ ( self ) : self . variable = 3 \"\"\" Docstring for instance variable. \"\"\" While the resulting variables have no __doc__ attribute, pdoc compensates by reading the source code (when available) and parsing the syntax tree. By convention, variables defined in a class' __init__ method and attached to self are considered and documented as instance variables. Class and instance variables can also inherit docstrings . Overriding docstrings with __pdoc__ Docstrings for objects can be disabled or overridden with a special module-level dictionary __pdoc__ . The keys should be string identifiers within the scope of the module or, alternatively, fully-qualified reference names. E.g. for instance variable self.variable of class C , its module-level identifier is 'C.variable' . If __pdoc__[key] = False , then key (and its members) will be excluded from the documentation of the module. Alternatively, the values of __pdoc__ should be the overriding docstrings. This particular feature is useful when there's no feasible way of attaching a docstring to something. A good example of this is a namedtuple : __pdoc__ = {} Table = namedtuple ( ' Table ' , [ ' types ' , ' names ' , ' rows ' ] ) __pdoc__ [ ' Table.types ' ] = ' Types for each column in the table. ' __pdoc__ [ ' Table.names ' ] = ' The names of each column in the table. ' __pdoc__ [ ' Table.rows ' ] = ' Lists corresponding to each row in the table. ' pdoc will then show Table as a class with documentation for the types , names and rows members. .. note:: The assignments to __pdoc__ need to be placed where they'll be executed when the module is imported. For example, at the top level of a module or in the definition of a class. Supported docstring formats Currently, pure Markdown (with extensions ), numpydoc , and Google-style docstrings formats are supported, along with some reST directives . Additionally, if latex_math template config option is enabled, LaTeX math syntax is supported when placed between recognized delimiters : \\(...\\) for inline equations and \\[...\\] or $$...$$ for block equations. Note, you need to escape your backslashes in Python docstrings ( \\\\( , \\\\frac{}{} , ...) or, alternatively, use raw string literals . Supported reST directives The following reST directives should work: specific and generic admonitions , .. image:: or .. figure:: (without options), .. include:: , with support for the options: :start-line: , :end-line: , :start-after: and :end-before: . .. math:: .. versionadded:: .. versionchanged:: .. deprecated:: .. todo:: Linking to other identifiers In your documentation, you may refer to other identifiers in your modules. When exporting to HTML, linking is automatically done whenever you surround an identifier with backticks ( ` ). The identifier name must be fully qualified, for example `pdoc.Doc.docstring` is correct (and will link to pdoc.Doc.docstring ) while `Doc.docstring` is not . Command-line interface pdoc includes a feature-rich \"binary\" program for producing HTML and plain text documentation of your modules. For example, to produce HTML documentation of your whole package in subdirectory 'build' of the current directory, using the default HTML template, run: $ pdoc --html --output-dir build my_package To run a local HTTP server while developing your package or writing docstrings for it, run: $ pdoc --http : my_package To re-build documentation as part of your continuous integration (CI) best practice, i.e. ensuring all reference links are correct and up-to-date, make warnings error loudly by settings the environment variable PYTHONWARNINGS before running pdoc: $ export PYTHONWARNINGS = 'error::UserWarning' For brief usage instructions, type: $ pdoc --help Programmatic usage The main entry point is pdoc.Module which wraps a module object and recursively imports and wraps any submodules and their members. After all related modules are wrapped (related modules are those that share the same pdoc.Context ), you need to call pdoc.link_inheritance with the used Context instance to establish class inheritance links. Afterwards, you can use pdoc.Module.html and pdoc.Module.text methods to output documentation in the desired format. For example: import pdoc modules = [ 'a' , 'b' ] # Public submodules are auto-imported context = pdoc . Context () modules = [ pdoc . Module ( mod , context = context ) for mod in modules ] pdoc . link_inheritance ( context ) def recursive_htmls ( mod ): yield mod . name , mod . html () for submod in mod . submodules (): yield from recursive_htmls ( submod ) for mod in modules : for module_name , html in recursive_htmls ( mod ): ... # Process When documenting a single module, you might find functions pdoc.html and pdoc.text handy. For importing arbitrary modules/files, use pdoc.import_module . Alternatively, use the runnable script included with this package. Custom templates To override the built-in HTML/CSS and plain text templates, copy the relevant templates from pdoc/templates directory into a directory of your choosing and edit them. When you run pdoc command afterwards, pass the directory path as a parameter to the --template-dir switch. .. tip:: If you find you only need to apply minor alterations to the HTML template, see if you can do so by overriding just some of the following, placeholder sub-templates: * [ _config . mako_ ]: Basic template configuration , affects the way templates are rendered . * _head . mako_ : Included just before ` </ head > `. Best for adding resources and styles . * _logo . mako_ : Included at the very top of the navigation sidebar . Empty by default . * _credits . mako_ : Included in the footer , right before pdoc version string . See [ default template files ] for reference . .. tip:: You can also alter individual config.mako preferences using the --config command-line switch. If working with pdoc programmatically, prepend the directory with modified templates into the directories list of the pdoc.tpl_lookup object. Compatibility pdoc requires Python 3.5+.
